    "## 6. Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated Mapping and Class Indexing\n",
    "\t\n",
    "•\tAutomatic Class Mapping: The merging script automatically handles class mapping by converting class names to lowercase and merging classes that are identical in a case-insensitive manner. This ensures that classes like “Person” and “person” are treated as the same class, preventing duplication and ensuring consistency.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "•\tOrder Preservation: The order of classes as they appear in data.yaml is preserved. This is crucial because YOLO-NAS relies on this order for class indexing during training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checkpoint Management\n",
    "\t\n",
    "•\tAutomatic Checkpoint Searching: During validation, the script automatically searches for the latest checkpoint by sorting the subdirectories (which are named with date and time) and selecting the most recent one (ckpt_best.pth).\n",
    "\t\n",
    "•\tCheckpoint Directory Structure: YOLO-NAS organizes checkpoints into subdirectories named with the date and time of the training run (e.g., 2024-04-27_15-30-00). This structure helps in easily identifying and retrieving the latest or specific checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### mAP Evaluation Output Management\n",
    "\t\n",
    "•\tCleaning Before Evaluation: Before performing a new mAP evaluation, the script cleans the existing mAP input directories to ensure that previous results do not interfere with the current evaluation.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "•\tMoving Evaluation Results: Since mAP evaluation results are overwritten in subsequent runs, it’s recommended to move the results to a separate directory after each evaluation. Use the --mAP_output_move_dir flag to specify the destination directory.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "•\tDirectory Creation: If the specified destination directory for mAP results does not exist, the script automatically creates it, preventing errors during the move operation.\n"
